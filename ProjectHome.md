Derp World is a classic platformer game built in C++ with the SFML library.
It's currently in alpha stage, this means it's playable but it probably contains a lot of bugs and it's not very feature-rich yet.

Implemented:
  * Map loading (maps can be made with the open-source Tiled map editor)
  * Animation handling
  * Collision detection
  * Mobs
  * Coins
  * Cannons
